## 🧠 Project Overview

This project develops and compares multiple machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the extreme class imbalance typical in fraud detection datasets, the analysis explores both undersampling and oversampling strategies to balance the data and enhance model performance.

The models are evaluated using key performance metrics such as ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score, with the goal of identifying the model that best distinguishes fraudulent from legitimate transactions.

## 📂 Dataset Description

- **Source:** Publicly available, anonymized credit card transaction dataset.  
- **Shape:** 284,807 rows × 31 columns  
- **Target Variable:** Class 
  - `0` → Legitimate transactions  
  - `1` → Fraudulent transactions  
- **Features:**
  - `V1`–`V28`: PCA-transformed numerical features
  - `Time`, `Amount`: Non-PCA features requiring scaling  

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Confirmed **no missing values**.  
- Fraudulent cases represent **~0.172%** of total records.  
- Correlation heatmaps verified orthogonality of PCA features.  
- Visualized the distribution of all variables and performed frequency analysis of fraud vs non-fraud classes

### 2. Feature Scaling
| Feature | Scaler Used | Justification |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `Amount` | `RobustScaler` | Handles outliers and skew |
| `Time` | `MinMax` | Scales to a fixed range [0, 1] |
| `V1–V28` | None | Already scaled via PCA |

> PCA inherently standardizes data before component extraction, so additional scaling is unnecessary.

### 3. Train–Test Split
- Split: **80% training / 20% testing**
- Stratified to preserve class proportions (for base model evaluation)
- Fixed `random_state` for reproducibility  

### 4. Handling Class Imbalance
Two rebalancing strategies were used:
- **Random Undersampling** → Downsampled the majority (non-fraud) class.  
- **SMOTE Oversampling** → Generated synthetic fraud samples to achieve a balanced dataset.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

| Model | Sampling Strategy | Purpose |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | Base / Undersampled / Oversampled | Linear baseline |
| Decision Tree Classifier | Base / Undersampled / Oversampled | Captures nonlinear relationships |
| Random Forest Classifier | Base / Undersampled / Oversampled | Ensemble learner to reduce variance |
| Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC) | Base / Undersampled / Oversampled | Maximizes class separation margin |

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
Each model was evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC**
- **Confusion Matrix**

> 🎯 *High recall and ROC-AUC are prioritized since undetected fraud (false negatives) is more costly than false positives.*

## 🔑 Key Insights

Handling class imbalance dramatically improved fraud detection performance.

Imbalanced models appeared strong at first glance, with 99%+ accuracy, but failed to detect many fraud cases (recall below 70%). This confirmed that accuracy alone is misleading in imbalanced problems.

Balancing the data through undersampling and SMOTE oversampling shifted performance toward what truly matters — identifying fraudulent activity. Recall rose above 90% across models, and ROC-AUC values approached 0.98–0.99.

Random Forest achieved perfect metrics after SMOTE, but its 100% training accuracy suggested overfitting. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVC delivered consistently high recall and ROC-AUC without overfitting, making them more reliable for real-world use.

📈 Final takeaway: Balancing the dataset proved essential. For production, a SMOTE-balanced Logistic Regression or Linear SVC offers the best mix of recall, stability, and interpretability.
- Models trained on the imbalanced dataset had deceptively high accuracy but low fraud detection sensitivity.  
- Class balancing significantly improved **recall** and **AUC**, the two most critical metrics in fraud detection.
