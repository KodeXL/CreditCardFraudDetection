## üß† Project Overview

This project applies **machine learning** techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions within a highly imbalanced dataset.  
By leveraging **sampling strategies** (undersampling & oversampling), **scaling optimization**, and **model comparison**, the analysis identifies the most effective fraud detection model.

üìå **Goal:** Maximize **recall** and **ROC-AUC** while maintaining strong precision to minimize false positives.  

---

## üìÇ Dataset Description

- **Source:** Publicly available, anonymized credit card transaction dataset.  
- **Shape:** 284,807 rows √ó 31 columns  
- **Target Variable:** Class 
  - `0` ‚Üí Legitimate transactions  
  - `1` ‚Üí Fraudulent transactions  
- **Features:**
  - `V1`‚Äì`V28`: PCA-transformed numerical features
  - `Time`, `Amount`: Non-PCA features requiring scaling  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Confirmed **no missing values**.  
- Fraudulent cases represent **~0.172%** of total records.  
- Correlation heatmaps verified orthogonality of PCA features.  
- Visualized the distribution of all variables and performed frequency analysis of fraud vs non-fraud classes

### 2. Feature Scaling
| Feature | Scaler Used | Justification |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `Amount` | `RobustScaler` | Handles outliers and skew |
| `Time` | `MinMax` | Scales to a fixed range [0, 1] |
| `V1‚ÄìV28` | None | Already scaled via PCA |

> PCA inherently standardizes data before component extraction, so additional scaling is unnecessary.

### 3. Train‚ÄìTest Split
- Split: **80% training / 20% testing**
- Stratified to preserve class proportions (for base model evaluation)
- Fixed `random_state` for reproducibility  

### 4. Handling Class Imbalance
Two rebalancing strategies were used:
- **Random Undersampling** ‚Üí Downsampled the majority (non-fraud) class.  
- **SMOTE Oversampling** ‚Üí Generated synthetic fraud samples to achieve a balanced dataset.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

| Model | Sampling Strategy | Purpose |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | Base / Undersampled / Oversampled | Linear baseline |
| Decision Tree Classifier | Base / Undersampled / Oversampled | Captures nonlinear relationships |
| Random Forest Classifier | Base / Undersampled / Oversampled | Ensemble learner to reduce variance |
| Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC) | Base / Undersampled / Oversampled | Maximizes class separation margin |

---

## üìà Evaluation Metrics
Each model was evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC**
- **Confusion Matrix**

> üéØ *High recall and ROC-AUC are prioritized since undetected fraud (false negatives) is more costly than false positives.*

## üèÜ Key Insights

- **Balanced Oversampled Random Forest** achieved **ROC-AUC = 1.00** and perfect recall, meaning it identified every fraudulent transaction in the test set.  
- **Balanced Oversampled Logistic Regression** followed closely (ROC-AUC ‚âà 0.9888), maintaining strong interpretability.  
- **Undersampling** provided competitive but slightly lower recall.  
- Models trained on the imbalanced dataset had deceptively high accuracy but low fraud detection sensitivity.  
- Class balancing significantly improved **recall** and **AUC**, the two most critical metrics in fraud detection.

> üß© **Conclusion:** The best overall model was the **Random Forest (SMOTE-balanced)**, achieving near-perfect classification while avoiding false negatives.
